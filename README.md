# Python projects
 Projects I coded in my first year of Computer Science

'Main.py' is a location tracker that parses a phone number and determines its location using the phonenumbers library. It then queries the OpenCage Geocode API to obtain latitude and longitude coordinates for that location. Using folium, it creates a map centered at those coordinates and adds a marker with the location description.
